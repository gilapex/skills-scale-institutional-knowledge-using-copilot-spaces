# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Summary

OctoAcme uses structured, iterative project management principles to deliver customer value, ensure clarity of roles, and support continuous improvement throughout the project lifecycle. 

### Key Project Management Processes

Our approach emphasizes:
- **Customer-first delivery**: Prioritizing customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative execution**: Delivering small, testable increments with regular feedback loops
- **Clear ownership**: Named Project Managers (PM) and Product Leads for every project
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measuring impact and iterating based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encouraging feedback and learning across the team
- **Risk management**: Proactive identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks
- **Cross-functional collaboration**: Regular communication and alignment across teams

### Project Lifecycle Overview

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle:
1. **Initiation** — Define the problem, stakeholders, and high-level timeline
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments and establish dependencies
3. **Execution** — Build, test, review, and iterate with regular team synchronization
4. **Release** — Deploy to production with verification and stakeholder communication
5. **Close & Retrospective** — Capture learnings and drive continuous improvement
